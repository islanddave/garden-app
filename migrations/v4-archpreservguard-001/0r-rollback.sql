-- 0r-rollback.sql
-- BUG-ARCHPRESERVGUARD-001 — restores both archive routines and both preservation_log FKs to their
-- pre-migration state, byte-for-byte. The function bodies below are the LIVE definitions captured
-- from pg_get_functiondef on 2026-08-13 immediately before 0c was authored.
--
-- WHAT ROLLING BACK RE-ARMS:
--   * archive_plant_events / archive_container_events silently strip the provenance from every
--     put-up record made from the harvests they archive — the jar stays, its source vanishes;
--   * a direct `DELETE FROM harvest_log` still nulls the pointer — it always did, and this
--     migration never changed that (see 0c section 3).
--
-- SAFE AT ANY TIME. Widening a referential action never fails on existing data, and replacing a
-- function touches no row. Nothing here reads or writes application data.
--
-- REHEARSAL CONTRACT: run on STAGING before 0c is applied anywhere — apply 0c, run this, confirm
-- neither function body mentions preservation_log, then re-apply 0c.
--
-- The schema_version row is left in place on purpose: it is an applied-history log, not a state
-- flag. gates.yml keys on confdeltype and on prosrc, so a rolled-back database reports honestly.
